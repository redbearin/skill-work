Create a Circle() constructor that takes the radius as a single argument and has the following properties and methods:

.radius
.diameter
.getC() (get circumference)
.getA() (get area)
Instantiate this constructor with two circles:

c1 has radius 3
c2 has radius 5
For example, if I used the Circle constructor to instantiate a new instance called c0 with a radius of 1, I would have:

Examples

c0.radius ➞ 1

c0.diameter ➞ 2

c0.getC() ➞ 6.28

c0.getA() ➞ 3.14
Notes

Circumference: 2πr. Area: πr^2.
Use Math.PI for calculating circumference and area.
Round the perimeter and area results to the nearest hundredths place.
