Create a function that takes a string and returns the right answer.

Examples
postfix("2 2 +") ➞ 4

postfix("2 2 /") ➞ 1

postfix("8 4 / 9 * 3 1 * /") ➞ 54
seems like this might be the wrong answer
my algorithm gets and answer of 6
should have been more clear about how you wish to have us get
to the final number

Notes
The operators + - * / may be supported.
Output always returns an integer.
