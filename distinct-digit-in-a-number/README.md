Write a function that includes a regular expression to determine if the numbers has digits that are not repeated (i.e. digits are distinct).

Examples
regularExpression.test("123") ➞ true

regularExpression.test("112233") ➞ false

regularExpression.test("1025") ➞ true

Notes
Input is a number as a string.
Note, this was modified slightly to include a function rather than just the regular expression. A little cleaner from my perspective since it is compartmentalized.
