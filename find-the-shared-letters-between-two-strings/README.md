Given two strings, return a string containing only the letters shared between the two.

Examples
sharedLetters("house", "home") ➞ "eho"

sharedLetters("Micky", "mouse") ➞ "m"

sharedLetters("house", "villa") ➞ ""

Notes sharedLetters:
If none of the letters are shared, return an empty string.
The function should be case insensitive (e.g. comparing A and a should return a).
Sort the resulting string alphabetically before returning it.
