Write a function which increments a string to create a new string.

If the string ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.

If the string doesn't end with a number, 1 should be added to the new string.

If the number has leading zeros, the amount of digits should be considered.

Examples
incrementString("foo") ➞ "foo1"

incrementString("foobar0009") ➞ "foobar0010"

incrementString("foo099") ➞ "foo100"
