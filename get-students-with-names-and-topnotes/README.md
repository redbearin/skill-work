Create a function that takes an array of objects like { name: 'John', notes: [3, 5, 4]} and returns an array of objects like { name: "John", topNote: 5 }.

If student has no notes (an empty array) then let's assume topNote: 0.

Examples
[
  { name: "John", notes: [3, 5, 4]}
] âžž [
  { name: "John", topNote: 5}
]

Notes
Try solving this challenge with an arrow function.
