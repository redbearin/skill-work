Examples

constraint("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") ➞ "Pangram"
// The sentence contains every letter of the alphabet.
// Repetitions are not considered.

constraint("The big dwarf only jumps.") ➞ "Heterogram"
// The sentence has only unique characters.

constraint("Todd told Tom to take the tiny turtles.") ➞ "Tautogram"
// Every word starts with the letter "t".

constraint("A cannibal alligator has attacked an unaware vegan alligator.") ➞ "Transgram"
// Every word contains the letter "a".

Notes
I modified the instructions to included sentences that could include more than one item. 

For the first cut, there will only be one capital at the beginning and one period at the end.
