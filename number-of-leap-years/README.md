Examples
numLeapYears("1980-1984") ➞ 2
// 1980 and 1984 are leapyears.

numLeapYears("2000-2020") ➞ 6

numLeapYears("1600-2000") ➞ 98

Notes
Remember that a hyphen separates the years.
Check the Resources tab for help on checking whether a year is a leap year.

Criteria

- If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year;

unless...
- The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
